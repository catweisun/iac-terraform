# Module service-plan

A terraform module that provisions and scales an app service plan with the following characteristics: 

- Ability to specify resource group name in which the App Service Plan is deployed.
- Ability to specify resource group location in which the App Service Plan is deployed.
- Also gives ability to specify following settings for App Service Plan based on the requirements:
  - kind : The kind of the App Service Plan to create.
  - tags : A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.
  - reserved : Is this App Service Plan Reserved.
  - tier : Specifies the plan's pricing tier.
  - size : Specifies the plan's instance size.
  - capacity : Specifies the number of workers associated with this App Service Plan.

## Usage

```
module "resource_group" {
  source = "github.com/danielscholl/iac-terraform/modules/resource-group"

  name     = "iac-terraform"
  location = "eastus2"
}

module "service_plan" {
  source              = "github.com/danielscholl/iac-terraform/modules/service_plan"
  name                = "iac-terraform-plan-${module.resource_group.random}"
  resource_group_name = module.resource_group.name

  resource_tags = {
    iac = "terraform"
  }
}
```

## Outputs

Once the deployments are completed successfully, the output for the current module will be in the format mentioned below:

- `name`: The URL of the service plan created
- `id`: The resource id of the service plan created
