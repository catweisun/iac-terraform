# Module service-plan

A terraform module that provisions and scales an app service plan with the following characteristics: 

- Ability to specify resource group name in which the App Service Plan is deployed.
- Ability to specify resource group location in which the App Service Plan is deployed.
- Also gives ability to specify following settings for App Service Plan based on the requirements:
  - kind : The kind of the App Service Plan to create.
  - tags : A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.
  - reserved : Is this App Service Plan Reserved.
  - tier : Specifies the plan's pricing tier.
  - size : Specifies the plan's instance size.
  - capacity : Specifies the number of workers associated with this App Service Plan.

Once the deployments are completed successfully, the output for the current module will be in the format mentioned below:

```
Outputs:
